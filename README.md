# Genetic-Algorithims-Python
Some fun code I wrote. One file does string matching and another one solves the Knapsack problem. 


The Knapsack problem is solved using a python implementation of bitarrays. Each gene is repersented with as an array of actual bits, not bloated bools or worse yet, ints. Such a design decision was made because I am solving the 0-1 knapsack problem. It's trivial to replace these bitarrays with normal lists and convert this GA To one that can solve the more general knapsack problem. 

Regardless, I'm impressed by the results I can achieve and may use this to make my Skyrim runs more fun :)
